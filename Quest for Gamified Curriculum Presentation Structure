The Quest for a Gamified Computer Lab Curriculum

About My Program in General [add picture of students &/or lab]
  It is a State Approved CTE POS
  Computer Technology
  2 levels of Web Design
    Both are folded into 1 course
    with 2 sections every year (so far)
  2 Levels of Programming
    Both folded with 2 sections
  2nd level is a Capstone Class with an Independent Project
  NOTE: I'll get to the tools later

A Few More Details for those who are interested [Add picture of Web & Pro students]
  Web Design Details:
    I teach coding by hand with text editor
      HTML
      CSS
      JavaScript
    I offer dual credit with PCC
  Programming Details:
    P1 is Python
    P2 is Java
    I offer Game Design, App Design, & Computer Science as independent study

The Why
  Problems with Programming students and coding
  Problems with a Lock-step curriculum
  Problems with ability to help students
  Problems with pacing
  Problems with engagement
